# Remy vs Zombies

My wee lad is presently obsessed with Plants vs Zombies and wanted to make a clone and/or his own
take on it. I happened to be developing a game development platform at the time, so it seemed like
a good opportunity to combine father/son bonding with some eating of my own dogfood.

That said, corners are being cut copiously here because Remy is more concerned about what he sees
on the screen than what the code looks like, so he's a heartless project manager. Avert thine eyes
from the code lest ye wish them to burn.

## Building

Once we ship [TFW], you won't need it specially checked out next door, but for now you do. So
check it out and `yarn && yarn build` it, then you can `yarn && yarn start` in rpvz and that
should run things in a webpack dev server.
